    "The goal of this assignment is to implement a neural network that classifies images of 37 breeds of cats and dogs from the [Oxford-IIIT-Pet dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). The assignment is divided into two parts: first, you will be asked to implement from scratch your own neural network for image classification; then, you will fine-tune a pretrained network provided by PyTorch."
